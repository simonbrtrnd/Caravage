## About
Caravage allows you to check easily your design contrast accessibility with the 3.0 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.



You can either select individually any text layer or scan a selection and the plugin will automatically give you for each text:

- The colour(s) of the text.
- The colour(s) of the background directly behind the text.
- The font size and weight of the text.
- The contrast value based on WCAG 3.0 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and the new colour contrast method called [APCA](http://www.myndex.com/APCA/) (Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm).
- The minimum contrast value provided by the [APCA contrast look up table](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FJslU_ZVkAAlDjE?format=jpg&name=900x900).
